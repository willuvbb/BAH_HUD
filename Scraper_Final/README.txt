Thanks for looking at my twitter scraper!

To run, simply run the file "Scraper_Master.py".

Before that, you'll have to get a Twitter developer account, 
and the associated "access keys/tokens". You can do that at 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html

To search, start the app, select search mode, enter your query, 
and enter how many tweets you wish to collect (max=1000, unless 
you pay for a Premium API from Twitter. Follow these directions 
to make a query:
