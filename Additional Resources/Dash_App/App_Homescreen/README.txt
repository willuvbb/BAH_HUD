This was version #2 out of 3 of my web apps. So you can use it if you want, but the most recent one, as of August 2019, was made using standard html/javascript/bootstrap/flask.

Please run the "RUN_APP" executable file, either by double clicking or running it via the terminal. Or go to this folder in your terminal and type "python index.py".

Thanks,
Will
