Summer Games 2019, Social Media Analytics User Experience

Hello, and thanks for opening up this repository. It's a 
collection of the work that I did as a Summer Games Intern 
at Booz Allen Hamilton in summer 2019. This folder has 3 
main parts: 
1) Twitter Scraper--this downloads tweets related 
to the search terms that a user enters.
2) Tweet Classifier--this uses machine learning and 
natural language processing to classify tweets according 
to their content and emotion.
3) WebApp--I went through a few iterations of this and finally 
stuck with this method. It uses Flask, HTML, JavaScript, and 
CSS/Bootstrap, and uses a handful of javascript packages for 
making datatables and plots.

If anyone has questions about my code, or if I can be of 
any help, hit me up at willuvbb@gmail.com.

-Will
